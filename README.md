In todays world many people are seeking to know about their heritage, culture and family history. But there is another segment of the population that does not have this privilege these are the 5 million adoptees in the United States today. The search for birthparents and extended family members can be daunting and challenging depending the information available to the individual regarding their adoption. 

What if there was an option for individuals who have gone through a public adoption to go to a database and find if there is additional information regarding their history from their adoption agency, extended family member or a birth parent in search of them. 

My goal is to develop database for individuals who have undergone a public adoption in the United States.

Who would contributes to this database?
• Adoptee 
• Birthparent, siblings, or extended family member of an adoptee 
• Adoption agency 

They would provide the requested information and if there is a match of information for an adoptee they would be notified via email.

For privacy purposes only the Adoptee can choose to reach out to the individual who has provided the information.

This is an overview of the project

This is an image of the landing page, design to draw the users attention it uses socket.io each user adds a new line to the site. Going forward I would modify this so that if you are revisiting the site you will not add a line. This I will consider for further iterations.

## challenges
Understanding firesbase and seeing how simple it can be if you know what you are looking for. 

After working on this project, I understand developers stick to code and why designers stick to design. Its a challenge
making a useful functioning site that serves a purpose. I spent a lot of my time reading and watching tutorials in order tp get small things work like setting up the varialbe of the items. Then figure out how to get the number of user would be represented on the main page.
